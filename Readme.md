# Tommy Keirnan's Pomodoro App

Using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript, Tommy was able to create a Pomodoro application that provides the user with a tool to follow the Pomodoro productivity technique. When the user begins working, he or she starts the Work Timer. When the work timer is finished, an alarm is triggered and lets the user know it's time to take a break. The user should then use the Rest Timer, to rest no longer than five minutes.
